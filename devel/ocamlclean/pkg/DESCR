OCamlClean is part of the OCaPIC project. It is used to reduce the
size of executable files by statically eliminating deadcode.

It transforms a standard OCaml bytecode executable file in another
semantically equivalent one. A static analysis is performed to
detect closures (and their associated bytecode) that will never be
executed.

Keep in mind that this ignores dynamic linking and breaks the
compatibility with Dynlink module. Of course, preserving
compatibility with Dynlink makes no sense for deadcode elimination.
